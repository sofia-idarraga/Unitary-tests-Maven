# Unitary Tests with Maven - Workshop
## _By: Sofía Idárraga_

This project contains  a calculator to perform basic mathematical operations: 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Here you will find the tests in order to verify the correct functionality of
the calculator.

If you want to check the project just download it and go to
`src/test/java/co/com/sofka/app/calculator`. There you will find the 
`BasicCalculatorTest.java` and each of the tests build to this project.
